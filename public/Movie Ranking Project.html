<h3>The 6th Man</h3>
<p>A comedy, drama, fantasy, and sports film that is funny, entertaining, and heartwarming. One of my favorite sports movies of all time.</p>
<h3>Mortal Kombat (1995)</h3>
<p>An action pack martial arts film based on the popular fighting video game series. This is by far one of the best video game to movie adaptations ever made.</p>
